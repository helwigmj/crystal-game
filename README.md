## Crystal Game ##

Simple crystal game where crystals are given randomized values from 1-11 and a random number; the user has to click one to four of the crystals on the page to match the given value.

This game uses jQuery/Javascript to randomize values for four crystals on the page, randomize the value to guess, and then track the users current score as well as overall wins and losses.
